# JDCServices
Just Dance Custom Services, used for Just Dance Best/Online, I worked on up to June 2021.

**JDCS (Just Dance Custom Service)** is a mock-up of **Just Dance Unlimited (JMCS)** servers by Ubisoft.

**Just Dance Unlimited** is a online-subscription service created by Ubisoft back in 2015 for Just Dance 2016-2021 and on for Xbox One, Xbox Series, PS4, PS5, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PC and Google Stadia.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A server to host (duh)

## How to install

- Use `git clone https://github.com/devvjs/jdcservices.git` or download the repo as a ZIP file directly.
- Once you are done, go into `jdcservices` folder and run `npm i` to install all packages that are required.
- After that, you can run the server by `node jdcservices.js`.
